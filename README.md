### A template for webpack

Goal is a streamlined starting point for new static projects. Leans on Webpack
for processing / packaging files as well as local development. Exports into a
static site that can be quickly deployed.

**TODO**

- Import assets starting point
- Bare-bones structure (layouts, partials, etc.)
- Compile + optimize script
- Deploy to heroku script
- Have 'compile-jade' task auto-trigger a page reload
