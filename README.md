### A template for webpack

Goal is a streamlined starting point for new static projects. Leans on Webpack
for processing / packaging files as well as local development. Exports into a
static site that can be quickly deployed.

**TODO**

- Compile + optimize script
-- Better uglify settings (strip comments, etc.)
-- Pass webpack chunk hashs to jade
- Deploy to heroku script
- Have 'compile-jade' task auto-trigger a page reload
